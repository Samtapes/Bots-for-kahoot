# Bots-for-kahoot
This is a software that I create to make fun at Kahoot, it is very simple to use.

I reccomend you just add 8 bots, because if you add more, Kahoot will tell you to wait more time.

But a solution for this problem of limited 8 bots is: you can execute this software many times simultaneously (it depends of your RAM and computer hardware), and do you will have many google with 8 bots, and you can play with bots.

Maybe I develop an update that allows you to type in the software what awnser do you want that all bots will click (it depends if you want)


# Installation 

1. Using terminal go to the directory of the folder and run:

> pip install -r requirements.txt


2. After that, if you execute the software and you get an error, probably is the ChromeDriver. Is because your Chrome is in a version different of the ChromeDriver.
In this site:  https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads  you can find all the chromedriver versions of google, check your Chrome version before install.



3. Just run this software and have fun!!
