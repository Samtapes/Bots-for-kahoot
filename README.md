This is a software that I create to make fun at Kahoot, it is very simple to use


# Installation 

1. Using terminal go to the directory of the folder and run:

> pip install -r requirements.txt


2. After that, if do you is getting a error of the ChromeDriver, is because your Chrome is in a version different of the ChromeDriver.
In this site:  https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

you can find all the chromedriver versions of google, check your Chrome version before install.



3. Just run this software and have fun!!
